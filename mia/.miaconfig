#       if excluded, mia will run at 10 minute intervals
#
#   MANDATORY
#   DST_DIR=Full/Path/To/Destination/Directory
#       the file should only contain one destination directory. If multiple are found, the furthest
#       down valid directory will be used.
#
#   MANDATORY
#   CONVERTER=Full/Path/To/ReAdW.exe
#       the destination of the ReAdW executable that will convert the files
